# health-monitoring
Health Monitoring uses IoT technologies to implement a health monitoring system. This project leverages open standards such as AMQP MQTT, the open source project Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to enable device connectivity, as well as other open source projects (including Quarkus and Vert.x) to process health data and it is deployed using the Red Hat OpenShift platform.
